# Hospital Channeling System using Microservices Architecture

## Introduction

The primary objective of this assignment is to develop a simple Hospital Channeling System using a microservices architecture. The system will allow users to manage patients, doctors, and appointments efficiently. This project will enable our team to demonstrate a basic understanding of the microservices concept and provide a foundation for learning and exploring more advanced microservices features.

## Scope

The Hospital Channeling System will consist of three microservices and a frontend web-based user interface:

1. Patient Service: Manages patient data and performs CRUD operations.
2. Doctor Service: Manages doctor data and performs CRUD operations.
3. Appointment Service: Manages appointment data and performs CRUD operations.
4. Frontend UI: A simple web-based user interface to interact with the microservices.

## Technologies

1. Database: MySQL
2. Backend: Spring Boot
3. Frontend: HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript
4. Deployment: Azure (or local deployment, if preferred)
5. Version Control: GitHub

## Team Members and Roles

1. Member 1 - Patient Service:
   - Develop the Patient microservice.
   - Implement CRUD operations for patient data.
   - Create RESTful APIs for patient services.

2. Member 2 - Doctor Service:
   - Develop the Doctor microservice.
   - Implement CRUD operations for doctor data.
   - Create RESTful APIs for doctor services.

3. Member 3 - Appointment Service:
   - Develop the Appointment microservice.
   - Implement CRUD operations for appointment data.
   - Create RESTful APIs for appointment services.

4. Member 4 - Frontend Development:
   - Develop the user interface using HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript.
   - Integrate the frontend with the microservices' APIs.

5. Member 5 - Project Setup and Backend Infrastructure:
   - Set up the project structure, repositories, and development environment.
   - Implement basic security using Spring Security and JWT authentication.

6. Member 6 - Deployment and Documentation:
   - Deploy the microservices and the frontend application on Azure (or locally, if preferred).
   - Document each microservice's API using a simple tool or by manually creating API documentation.

## Timeline

Week 1:
- Set up GitHub repositories and organize the team.
- Start developing the microservices (Patient, Doctor, and Appointment).

Week 2:
- Complete the development of microservices.
- Start developing the frontend UI.

Week 3:
- Complete the frontend UI development.
- Integrate the frontend with the microservices' APIs.

Week 4:
- Test the components and fix any issues.
- Deploy the microservices and frontend application.
- Document the APIs and write README files for each repository.

## Deliverables

1. Patient, Doctor, and Appointment microservices with RESTful APIs.
2. Frontend web-based user interface for interacting with the microservices.
3. Deployment of the microservices and frontend application on Azure (or local deployment, if preferred).
4. API documentation and README files for each repository.

## Conclusion

By completing this assignment, our team will gain valuable experience in developing a basic Hospital Channeling System using a microservices architecture. This project will serve as a foundation for future projects and will provide a practical understanding of microservices concepts and best practices.
